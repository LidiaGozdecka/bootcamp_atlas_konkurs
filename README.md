# SKN Atlas competition
The goal of this competition was to train analyzing and building predicitive models on synthetic data which simulates credit risk assesments.
The initial analysis was done using r in Rstudio. Then, a linear regression model was built using python inside Rstudio, and a classification model was built in in Jupyterlab, using data exported from Rstudio.

data_atlas_clean.csv contains the dataset which was cleaned and modified in R to be further used in R visualization and in Jupyter
bootcamp_project.ipynb  contains the code written in jupyter to build the classification model
binary_clasification_results.csv is an export (from jupyterlab) of evaluation metrics of different classification models
