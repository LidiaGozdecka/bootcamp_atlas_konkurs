# SKN Atlas competition
The goal of this competition was to train analyzing and building predicitive models on synthetic data which simulates credit risk assesments.
The initial analysis was done using r in Rstudio. Then, a linear regression model was built using python inside Rstudio, and a classification model was built in in Jupyterlab, using data exported from Rstudio.

### Files overview
---
1. conf_matrix  - contains pngs of confusion matrices visualizing the accuracy of different classification models
2. data_atlas_clean.csv  - contains the dataset which was cleaned and modified in R to be further used in R visualization and in Jupyter
3. bootcamp_project.ipynb  -  contains the code written in jupyter to build the classification model
4. binary_clasification_results.csv - an export (from jupyterlab) of evaluation metrics of different classification models
