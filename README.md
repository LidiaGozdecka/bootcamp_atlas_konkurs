# SKN Atlas competition
The goal of this competition was to train analyzing and building predicitive models on synthetic data which simulates credit risk assesments.
The initial analysis was done using r in Rstudio. Then, a linear regression model was built using python inside Rstudio, and a classification model was built in in Jupyterlab, using data exported from Rstudio.
